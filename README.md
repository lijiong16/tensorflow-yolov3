## introduction

Implementation of YOLO v3 object detector in Tensorflow (TF-Slim). Inspired by [Pawe≈Ç Kapica](https://github.com/mystic123) and [Kiril Cvetkov
](https://github.com/kirilcvetkov92). The full details are in [this paper](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf).  This project we cover several segments as follows:<br>
- [x] YOLO v3 architecture
- [x] Weights converter (util for exporting loaded COCO weights as TF checkpoint)
- [x] Basic working demo
- [x] Training pipeline
